            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely held as one of the most
                 influential scientists. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein also made
                  important contributions to quantum mechanics.

                <h3>Special Theory of Relativity</h3>
                <p>Einstein proposed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, 
                    and that the speed of light is constant regardless of the observer's motion.
                     This theory introduced the concept of spacetime and led to the famous equation 
                    ùê∏ =ùëöùëê2 showing that mass and energy are interchangeable.
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Photoelectric Effect (1905)</h3>
                <p>
                    Einstein demonstrated that light consists of particles called photons, which can eject electrons from a material when they strike it. 
                    This work provided key evidence for quantum theory and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.

                <h3>Brownian Motion (1905)</h3>
                <p>
                    Einstein explained the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid as the result of collisions with atoms or molecules,
                    providing strong evidence for the existence of atoms and supporting the atomic theory of matter.

                <h3>General Theory of Relativity (1915)</h3>
                <p>
                    Einstein expanded on his earlier work by showing that gravity is not a force between masses,
                    but rather the result of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This theory
                    predicted phenomena like the bending of light around massive objects and the existence of
                    black holes.
